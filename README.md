# **Thaiba Zaib Resume**

## **Introduction**

My name is Thaiba Zaib and welcome to my first milestone project. I joined a Full Stack developer course with Code Institute.

The requirements for my first project was to showcase my skills by building a static website with HTML, CSS and implementing the Bootstrap library.

I hope you enjoy my first project!

## **UX-User Experience Design**

Before I started writing up my code for my resume project, I followed the UX design process, by Jason James Garrett's book "The Elements of User Experience".

The design process is based on 5 different planes. I will detail each plane below.

## **The Strategy Plane**

### **User Stories**

As a user, I want a navigation bar to be clearly visible at the top corner of the website, so that I can reach the relevant sections of the website.

As a user, I want an introduction, so that I can get to know Thaiba and understand the reason behind the project.

As a user, I want to be able to view the work history, so that I can see their experiences in past job roles.

As a user, I want to see the progression of the study area, so that I can understand how much they have learnt and where they currently are in the learning process.

As a user, I want to access the social media platforms, so that I can view their professional profiles and network with them.

As a user, I want to download their CV, so that I can view in detail any other relevant skills including hobbies and interests.

### **Creator Goals**

As a Creator, I want the project to be accessible and easy to navigate.

As a creator, I want each section to be defined with a heading and centered so that it looks neat and tidy.

As a creator, I want to include progress bars to indicate my skills and highlight my progress so far as a developer.

As a creator, I want the structure of my project to be eye catching.

From my user stories and creator goals, I had a clear idea of what was required to provide my users with a great experience while also providing them with the concised and relevant information.

### **The Scope Section**

During my strategy design process I was able to identify how I wanted to structure my resume project, however after doing some research with feedback from my peers, I found that certain fesatures of my project were not feasible. 

After careful consideration, I resalised the most ideal way of implementing my ideas would be to do this in phases, as you can see below:

*Phase 1*

- Have my features all on one page.
- Navigation bar to be clear and visible on the top corner of my project.
- Progress bars that shows the user my knowledge so far of HTML, CSS and Javascipt.
- A contact me section, so that user can contact me via email or phone.

*Phase 2*

- After completing the Javascript section of the project, I would then implement this into my resume project to make it interactive rather than static.
- Add to my skills section, to keep the users updated with my progression of the different coding languages I have learnt so far.
- Including social links for my references, so that the user can view their profiles on other social platforms.

What I hope to achieve is a great user experience, by creating a project that is eye catching as well as professional for businesses to view.

The goal of phase will mainly focus on making the current project more interactive and engaging for users.

### **The Structure Section**

With the structure of my project, I did some research on other resume profiles to give me the inspiration that I needed to make my project intreging to the user. By doing this it helped me to figure out what I needed to design my resume project.

I used [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

*Color Theme*

- Pastel pink #f3eaf2
- Shade of grey #cabfc7
- Darker shade of pink #b27ba1

I wanted to give my project a warm and nurturing theme that I felt would make myself approachable to the user.

*Typography*

- Noto Sans JP
- Sans Serif
- Dancing Script

Noto Sans JP font, created by Google is the main font for my title as well as most of the body of the text, as I feel this is easy to read, looks very light to match the smoothe feeling of the background colors.

I included Dancing Script, created by Impallari Type also from Google Fonts, this will be the secondary font used for the name title, logo at the top left corner of the page and the subheadings for each section. I felt that this font style complements the Sans Noto JP font, whilst giving my project a fancy look that would be eyecatching to the user.

Sans Serif, will be my fallback font. This is so that if the main fonts are not implemented in the project, then this font style will be the back-up.

*Profile Image*

I wanted my profile to be professional and centered in the header, so that this was the first thing that stands out as soon as the user views my project. I decided that I want to make the profile shaped into a circle, with a darker shade of pink dobule border around it, so that it gave the image a strong significance.

# **Thaiba Zaib Resume**

## **Introduction**

My name is Thaiba Zaib and welcome to my first milestone project. I joined a Full Stack developer course with Code Institute.

The requirements for my first project was to showcase my skills by building a static website with HTML, CSS and implementing the Bootstrap library.

I hope you enjoy my first project!

## **UX-User Experience Design**

Before I started writing up my code for my resume project, I followed the UX design process, by Jason James Garrett's book "The Elements of User Experience".

The design process is based on 5 different planes. I will detail each plane below.

## **The Strategy Plane**

### **User Stories**

As a user, I want a navigation bar to be clearly visible at the top corner of the website, so that I can reach the relevant sections of the website.

As a user, I want an introduction, so that I can get to know Thaiba and understand the reason behind the project.

As a user, I want to be able to view the work history, so that I can see their experiences in past job roles.

As a user, I want to see the progression of the study area, so that I can understand how much they have learnt and where they currently are in the learning process.

As a user, I want to access the social media platforms, so that I can view their professional profiles and network with them.

As a user, I want to download their CV, so that I can view in detail any other relevant skills including hobbies and interests.

### **Creator Goals**

As a Creator, I want the project to be accessible and easy to navigate.

As a creator, I want each section to be defined with a heading and centered so that it looks neat and tidy.

As a creator, I want to include progress bars to indicate my skills and highlight my progress so far as a developer.

As a creator, I want the structure of my project to be eye catching.

From my user stories and creator goals, I had a clear idea of what was required to provide my users with a great experience while also providing them with the concised and relevant information.

### **The Scope Section**

During my strategy design process I was able to identify how I wanted to structure my resume project, however after doing some research with feedback from my peers, I found that certain fesatures of my project were not feasible. 

After careful consideration, I resalised the most ideal way of implementing my ideas would be to do this in phases, as you can see below:

*Phase 1*

- Have my features all on one page.
- Navigation bar to be clear and visible on the top corner of my project.
- Progress bars that shows the user my knowledge so far of HTML, CSS and Javascipt.
- A contact me section, so that user can contact me via email or phone.

*Phase 2*

- After completing the Javascript section of the project, I would then implement this into my resume project to make it interactive rather than static.
- Add to my skills section, to keep the users updated with my progression of the different coding languages I have learnt so far.
- Including social links for my references, so that the user can view their profiles on other social platforms.

What I hope to achieve is a great user experience, by creating a project that is eye catching as well as professional for businesses to view.

The goal of phase will mainly focus on making the current project more interactive and engaging for users.

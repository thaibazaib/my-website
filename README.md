## **UX-User Experience Design**

Before I started writing up my code for my resume project, I followed the UX design process, by Jason James Garrett's book "The Elements of User Experience".

The design process is based on 5 different planes. I will detail each plane below.

## **The Strategy Plane**

### **User Stories**

As a user, I want a navigation bar to be clearly visible at the top corner of the website, so that I can reach the relevant sections of the website.

As a user, I want an introduction, so that I can get to know Thaiba and understand the reason behind the project.

As a user, I want to be able to view the work history, so that I can see their experiences in past job roles.

As a user, I want to see the progression of the study area, so that I can understand how much they have learnt and where they currently are in the learning process.

As a user, I want to access the social media platforms, so that I can view their professional profiles and network with them.

As a user, I want to download their CV, so that I can view in detail any other relevant skills including hobbies and interests.

### **Creator Goals**

As a Creator, I want the project to be accessible and easy to navigate.

As a creator, I want each section to be defined with a heading and centered so that it looks neat and tidy.

As a creator, I want to include progress bars to indicate my skills and highlight my progress so far as a developer.

As a creator, I want the structure of my project to be eye catching.

From my user stories and creator goals, I had a clear idea of what was required to provide my users with a great experience while also providing them with the concised and relevant information.

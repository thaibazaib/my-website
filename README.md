# **Thaiba Zaib Resume**

## **Introduction**

My name is Thaiba Zaib and welcome to my first milestone project. I joined a Full Stack developer course with Code Institute.

The requirements for my first project was to showcase my skills by building a static website with HTML, CSS and implementing the Bootstrap library.

I hope you enjoy my first project!

## **UX-User Experience Design**

Before I started writing up my code for my resume project, I followed the UX design process, by Jason James Garrett's book "The Elements of User Experience".

The design process is based on 5 different planes. I will detail each plane below.
 
---

## **The Strategy Plane**

### **User Stories**

As a user, I want a navigation bar to be clearly visible at the top corner of the website, so that I can reach the relevant sections of the website.

As a user, I want an introduction, so that I can get to know Thaiba and understand the reason behind the project.

As a user, I want to be able to view the work history, so that I can see their experiences in past job roles.

As a user, I want to see the progression of the study area, so that I can understand how much they have learnt and where they currently are in the learning process.

As a user, I want to access the social media platforms, so that I can view their professional profiles and network with them.

As a user, I want to download their CV, so that I can view in detail any other relevant skills including hobbies and interests.

### **Creator Goals**

As a Creator, I want the project to be accessible and easy to navigate.

As a creator, I want each section to be defined with a heading and centered so that it looks neat and tidy.

As a creator, I want to include progress bars to indicate my skills and highlight my progress so far as a developer.

As a creator, I want the structure of my project to be eye catching.

From my user stories and creator goals, I had a clear idea of what was required to provide my users with a great experience while also providing them with the concised and relevant information.

### **The Scope Section**

During my strategy design process I was able to identify how I wanted to structure my resume project, however after doing some research with feedback from my peers, I found that certain fesatures of my project were not feasible. 

After careful consideration, I resalised the most ideal way of implementing my ideas would be to do this in phases, as you can see below:

*Phase 1*

- Have my features all on one page.
- Navigation bar to be clear and visible on the top corner of my project.
- Progress bars that shows the user my knowledge so far of HTML, CSS and Javascipt.
- A contact me section, so that user can contact me via email or phone.

*Phase 2*

- After completing the Javascript section of the project, I would then implement this into my resume project to make it interactive rather than static.
- Add to my skills section, to keep the users updated with my progression of the different coding languages I have learnt so far.
- Including social links for my references, so that the user can view their profiles on other social platforms.

What I hope to achieve is a great user experience, by creating a project that is eye catching as well as professional for businesses to view.

The goal of phase will mainly focus on making the current project more interactive and engaging for users.

### **The Structure Section**

With the structure of my project, I did some research on other resume profiles to give me the inspiration that I needed to make my project intreging to the user. By doing this it helped me to figure out what I needed to design my resume project.

I used [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

*Color Theme*

- Pastel pink #f3eaf2
- Shade of grey #cabfc7
- Darker shade of pink #b27ba1

I wanted to give my project a warm and nurturing theme that I felt would make myself approachable to the user.

*Typography*

- Noto Sans JP
- Sans Serif
- Dancing Script

Noto Sans JP font, created by Google is the main font for my title as well as most of the body of the text, as I feel this is easy to read, looks very light to match the smoothe feeling of the background colors.

I included Dancing Script, created by Impallari Type also from Google Fonts, this will be the secondary font used for the name title, logo at the top left corner of the page and the subheadings for each section. I felt that this font style complements the Sans Noto JP font, whilst giving my project a fancy look that would be eyecatching to the user.

Sans Serif, will be my fallback font. This is so that if the main fonts are not implemented in the project, then this font style will be the back-up.

*Profile Image*

I wanted my profile to be professional and centered in the header, so that this was the first thing that stands out as soon as the user views my project. I decided that I want to make the profile shaped into a circle, with a darker shade of pink dobule border around it, so that it gave the image a strong significance.

### **The Skeleton Section**

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to create the wireframes for my project. I used this platform as I felt it was easy to use and straight forward. With this I was able to get an idea of what would work and look good for my project, also gave me a chance to see how I wanted to structure my project in the responsive view.

As I have now created my project, there are a few things I changed from when I crested my wireframes:

- The title and name is below the profile now as I felt it clashed with the navigation bar and the logo.
- The dark pink shade covers from the navigation bar to below the profile image/title. this is because I want the header to be seperate from the section of my project.
- Border around the paragraph of the home section. I want a style that was going to have it's own unique look to tell the user about me.
- With the Work-History section cards are inline and not set as block as there wasn't much context and appears neater this way.
- With the Study section, I created two seperate cards, so that both places I studied at are seperate, thsi is make it organised.
- With the Skills section, I explained what I have learnt so far in each module. This would be better for the user to have a short insight of my knowledge with what I have learnt so far.
- With the References section, I found a card on bootstrap that I felt worked better with how I want to display my references.
- Centered my content, to keep the content controlled and look professional.
- Decided to leave the footer at the end of the page rather than freezing the pane, to avoid the user from not look at all sections of my resume project.
- In mobile view, I found a Bootstrap navigation bar style that would place each of the navigation bar options into a menu to keep it neat and tidy.


Getting feedback from peers and my mentor inspired me to make these changes, as well as my own personal preference. I feel these changes made sense and give my project professional atmosphere.

### **The Surface Section**

There are many different features in my resume project, including the followimng:

- My resume project is responsive to different screen sizes, so that my project can be viewed on different technology devices. 
- Navigation Bar - This feature makes it easier to navigate the sections of the project. When in responsve, the navigation then turns into a hamburger menu to give the screen some space as the screen is a lot smaller. 
- Profile image - This image if for the user to identifier who the web designer is and I have displayed this in the center as soon as you enter the project.The border around the image help it stand out more and give it's own significance.
- Progress bar - This feature gives the user the understanding of the completion rate of each module.
- Background shades - I wanted the background of the header to stand out and be seperate from the sections.
- Font style - I switch between font styles, I chose the Dancing Script as I felt it catches the users attention and matches the color scheme very well.
- Footer - The foot includes the social links as well as download link for the CV.

Featues to implement:

- My resume project is currently static, however once I have learnt the Javascript module I would like to make this interactive.
- Include social links for my references, so the user can see their profiles.
- Add links to different projects I create during this course, so users can view my work.

## **Testing**

[User Stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2CXb4icwdBFX5mGJAwQGvMhPys7AZ6inpeyvuqflHk/edit?usp=sharing)

### **Testing used for my project**

- The project was tested on Google Chrome.
- The project was texted manually on an iPad.
- Utilised the inspecter setting of Google Chrome whilst I was developing the project, to test if it was responsive on different screen sizes.


At the end of the project, I wanted to make sure my code was neat and valid with no errors detected. To do this, I used the following formatting and validation tools:

- [HTML Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html)

- [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

    - [Result](html_validation_results.PNG)

- [CSS Formatter](https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/)

- [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

    - [Results](css_validation_results.PNG)


### **Bugs and Fixes**

During the creation of my resume project, I came across a few issues that I had to fix:

- Profile image - The image was not centered or displayed on the live website.
    
    - There was an extra / in the image element tag, once this was removed the image was then visible on the live website.
    - The image also wasn't responsive when testing on smaller screen sizes. In the profile class, I changed the height and width so that the image was responsive.

- Title headings - The background header was not responsive, so I added in media queries for the title headings to make it responsive.

- Card style - When in responsive setting, the text would come out of the card. I then added in media query, overflow: scroll; to make the text stay inside of the card style.

- Font style - Noticed that my font style 'Noto Sans JP' was not embedded into my resume project.

    - I realised the issue was that I had the incorrect import link. Went to google fonts to get the correct link.
    - Also hadn't placed the 'Noto Sans JP' in the body, added this to the body and my code was then fixed.
